When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I work from different places (e.g., from office and from home), if I have
    other people involved in the project I work on

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because in this way I only have to merge when I want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches can be used anywhere, but it makes sense to create them locally 
    first, for example, when working on an experimental feature. When you clone
    somebody's repository, you can contribute to it the same way as the author,
    all your changes will be pushed in the initial repository. When you fork 
    somebody's repository, your changes won't affect the initial repository, 
    only your forked version.
